# compound
This repository stores the account situation by quarters from 2020, July.
To investigate the relation between borrow rate in Compound and BTC trades, I download the past aggregated trades of BTC spot and future markets (https://data.binance.vision/?prefix=), and then summary trade quality and total money by days. Since the original files of monthly transactions are huge, I only upload the converted and summaried csv files, and python codes.
